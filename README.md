# music-social-network
This repository contains the source code, assets and example user data for a music social network created  
for the Systems Software module in my second year.  It was co-created by myself and Tommy Godfrey.  
Both the server and client are included, the server is multi-threaded and can connect to multiple clients.  
The client is currently set up to connect to a server on the same machine, but could be set up to connect to  
a server over the internet.
